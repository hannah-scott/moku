# moku

An Atom feed generator for the [HTML Journal](https://journal.miso.town/) format, an journalling format that is designed to be easy to syndicate.

## Usage

Update the filename, title and URL in `moku.py`, then run. It will output an Atom feed as `atom.atom` in the directory you're running from.

**Note:** if you have more than one `h1` element in your page, including in a navbar, then bad things will happen. I know this from experience.
